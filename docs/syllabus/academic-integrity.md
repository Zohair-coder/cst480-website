title: Academic Integrity Policies

This course follows both the [CCI Conduct Policy](https://drexel.edu/cci/current-students/policies/) and the [Drexel University Academic Integrity Policy](https://drexel.edu/studentlife/community_standards/code-of-conduct/academic-integrity-policy/).

In short, your work must be your own. Unless explicitly allowed, sharing solutions with anyone who is not an instructor or TA, borrowing significant ideas or code from any resource not given in class, or using AI tools to generate code is prohibited. See the attached PDF for more details. If you're unsure whether some behavior may violate the Academic Integrity Policy, you are always welcome to ask in *advance*. You will never be punished for asking.

All academic integrity violations will be reported to the university:
- The first time you violate the Academic Integrity Policy in this course this term, you will receive either a zero on the assignment or exam the violation took place on, or a deduction of one whole letter grade from your course final grade (e.g. an A- becomes a B-), depending on the severity of the violation.
  - If your first violation is unusually severe (e.g. stealing exam solutions and distributing them to the class before a test), you may receive an F after your first violation.
- If you violate the Academic Integrity Policy a subsequent time in this course this term, you will receive an F for your course final grade.
