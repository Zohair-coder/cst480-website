- If you have a general question about assignment requirements or how to approach a problem, we encourage you to post in the public #questions channel so everyone can read our answers. If you have a more specific question or feel shy, you can message a TA/instructor directly. Never post solutions in a public channel.
- Be professional, respectful, and polite to your fellow students and TAs/instructors. We like to have fun, but remember that our Discord server is a classroom environment. Help us create a welcoming environment by avoiding inapproprate jokes, swearing, or rudeness. If you violate the Student Code of Conduct, your behavior will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.
- Feel free to send messages at any time, but allow us 48 business hours to respond (though we'll usually respond sooner than that). We'll try to get to your message as soon as possible, but don't expect us to check Discord on weekends, early mornings, or late at night. If you want guaranteed immediate responses, come to class or office hours. If you wait until just before a deadline to ask for help, you probably won't get help in time. That's on you. Plan ahead.
- Your TAs are human beings and students like you. Please treat them with respect. Please also respect your professors' time. We care deeply about your education, but we have to balance your needs with our needs and the needs of all of our students.
