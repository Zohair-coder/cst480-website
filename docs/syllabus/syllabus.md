## What this course is about

Building on CS375, we'll dive deeper into web development, focusing on programming full-stack web applications. Topics may include front-end frameworks, API architecture, authentication, deployment, security, and testing.

## Logistics and how we'll use class time

- Classes will be held in person.
- All classes will be recorded using Echo.
- If class must be held online (e.g. due to illness), an announcement will be sent out, and we'll use Zoom.
- We'll spend the first half of this class learning advanced web development. Some classes will have lectures, others will have live coding, others will have class discussions on pre-assigned readings, and others will have programming activities due at the end of class. Each week, you'll complete a programming homework assignment.
- We'll spend the second half of this class on a group final project. Each week, your group will attend an in-person check-in with your instructor and submit a progress report detailing your weekly contributions. You'll present your project live during our final exam timeslot so your classmates can see what you've made.

## Resources you'll need for this course

- There is no official course textbook. All readings will be available online and free.
- Assignments will be submitted over Blackboard.
- We'll use Discord for Q&A. See the "Discord Info for CCI" content area in the Blackboard sidebar for instructions on how to join the CCI server. Once you join the CCI server, you'll automatically be given permission to view this course's Discord category, usually by the end of week 1. If after a week you still haven't been given permission, email ihelp@drexel.edu.

## Grades, due dates, and late policies

Final grades will be determined by your total points weighted according to this distribution:
- Activities: 10%
- Homeworks: 40%
- Project: 50%

Due dates and late policies:
- Activities
  - Some classes will have an in-class activity completed during class and due at the end of class.
  - Late activities won't be accepted without prior approval from your instructor.
  - Instead, the lowest activity grade will be dropped.
  - Activities will be graded on effort — students who complete the majority of the activity at least mostly correctly will receive full credit.

- Homeworks
  - Homeworks can be submitted up to 48 hours late.
  - Your assignment will receive a 10% penalty for each 24 hour period it's submitted after the due date (rounded up).
  - No assignments will be accepted after the 48 hour cut-off unless you have prior approval from your instructor.

- Late passes
  - You have 6 late passes.
  - One late pass removes one 10% late penalty on a single homework assignment.
  - You can use multiple late passes on the same assignment.
  - To use a late pass, message a TA or instructor stating which homework/how many late passes you want to use.
  - You should message them as you're submitting the homework — you don't need to message before you've submitted, and we won't apply late passes if we're messaged several days after you've already submitted.

- Final project
  - Any assignments associated with the final project won't be accepted late.

- Accommodations
  - To request an exemption from the late policies due to a documented medical issue or disability, you will need to register with the Office of Disability Resources.
Accommodations should be requested as far in advance as possible as it can take time for ODR to process them.

Final grades may be curved but are generally computed via the formula below:

| Range      | Grade |
|------------|-------|
| [100-97]   | A+    |
| [97-93]    | A     |
| [93-90]    | A-    |
| [90-87]    | B+    |
| [87-83]    | B     |
| [83-80]    | B-    |
| [80-77]    | C+    |
| [77-73]    | C     |
| [73-70]    | C-    |
| [70-67]    | D+    |
| [67-60]    | D     |
| [60-0]     | F     |

The only extra credit opportunities usually offered are for completing your end-of-term course evaluations and any course feedback surveys sent out by your instructor.
