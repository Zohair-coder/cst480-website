Your group will submit one PDF for your contract review, which should contain the following information:

1. The URL to your deployed public site.
2. A checklist of your original project requirements as laid out in the contract that was emailed to you when your project proposal was approved. For each item on the checklist, you should check off if you accomplished that item. If you didn’t, you should explain why it wasn’t implemented.

This PDF doesn’t need to be long — the purpose is to give me an opportunity to evaluate whether your project accomplished its goals as a whole, as each progress report grade only pertained to that week’s progress.

Additionally, you should ensure that **your project’s main branch works and I can run your web app locally**. Your readme should contain all needed instructions to get it running, and any API keys or other needed secrets should be emailed to me.
