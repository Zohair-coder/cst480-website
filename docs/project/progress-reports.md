title: Progress Reports

For weeks 6 - 10 (inclusive), on Saturday, your group will submit one
progress report. Your progress report should be a text or PDF file
containing the following information:

1. A link to your code repo (remember to give my user permission if
it’s private)
2. A summary of each member’s contributions from the previous week
3. A summary of each member’s plan for what they’ll work on in the
coming week

I will check each group member’s git commits throughout the prior
week (beginning of day Sunday through EOD Saturday) to gauge whether
each member is making a substantiative contribution. Superficial changes
— tweaking variable names, changing whitespace/formatting — and edits to
CSS files are *not* considered substantiative.

Your lowest progress report grade will be dropped, so it’s okay if
you have a week where you don’t make a substantial contribution.
