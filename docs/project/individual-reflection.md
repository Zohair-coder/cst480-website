# Project individual reflection

Each group member will individually submit a PDF reflecting on the project as a whole. You should answer the following questions:

1. What do you think went well regarding the overall process of you and your group working on the final project?
2. What do you think could’ve been improved about the overall process of working on the final project?
3. What was the most difficult part of the project for you, and what made it difficult?
4. Do you think your project’s scope was appropriate for the time frame (e.g. not too few or too many requirements)? If not, what would you have wanted to change about your proposal/contract?
5. Do you have any feedback for me about things you’d like to see from the first half of the course to better prepare students for the final project or during the second half of the course to better support groups while they’re working on their projects?
6. Do you have anything else you’d like to share?

Your reflection will not be shared with anyone except your graders.
