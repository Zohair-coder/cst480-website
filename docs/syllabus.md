## Teaching assistants

## What this course is about

Building on CS375, we'll dive deeper into web development, focusing on programming full-stack web applications. Topics may include front-end frameworks, API architecture, authentication, deployment, security, and testing.

## Logistics and how we'll use class time

- Classes will be held in person.
- All classes will be recorded using Echo.
- If class must be held online (e.g. due to illness), an announcement will be sent out, and we'll use Zoom.
- We'll spend the first half of this class learning advanced web development. Some classes will have lectures, others will have live coding, others will have class discussions on pre-assigned readings, and others will have programming activities due at the end of class. Each week, you'll complete a programming homework assignment.
- We'll spend the second half of this class on a group final project. Each week, your group will attend an in-person check-in with your instructor and submit a progress report detailing your weekly contributions. You'll present your project live during our final exam timeslot so your classmates can see what you've made.

## Resources you'll need for this course

- There is no official course textbook. All readings will be available online and free.
- Assignments will be submitted over Blackboard.
- We'll use Discord for Q&A. See the "Discord Info for CCI" content area in the Blackboard sidebar for instructions on how to join the CCI server. Once you join the CCI server, you'll automatically be given permission to view this course's Discord category, usually by the end of week 1. If after a week you still haven't been given permission, email ihelp@drexel.edu.

## Grades, due dates, and late policies

Final grades will be determined by your total points weighted according to this distribution:
- Activities: 10%
- Homeworks: 40%
- Project: 50%

Due dates and late policies:
- Activities
  - Some classes will have an in-class activity completed during class and due at the end of class.
  - Late activities won't be accepted without prior approval from your instructor.
  - Instead, the lowest activity grade will be dropped.
  - Activities will be graded on effort — students who complete the majority of the activity at least mostly correctly will receive full credit.

- Homeworks
  - Homeworks can be submitted up to 48 hours late.
  - Your assignment will receive a 10% penalty for each 24 hour period it's submitted after the due date (rounded up).
  - No assignments will be accepted after the 48 hour cut-off unless you have prior approval from your instructor.

- Late passes
  - You have 6 late passes.
  - One late pass removes one 10% late penalty on a single homework assignment.
  - You can use multiple late passes on the same assignment.
  - To use a late pass, message a TA or instructor stating which homework/how many late passes you want to use.
  - You should message them as you're submitting the homework — you don't need to message before you've submitted, and we won't apply late passes if we're messaged several days after you've already submitted.

- Final project
  - Any assignments associated with the final project won't be accepted late.

- Accommodations
  - To request an exemption from the late policies due to a documented medical issue or disability, you will need to register with the Office of Disability Resources.
Accommodations should be requested as far in advance as possible as it can take time for ODR to process them.

Final grades may be curved but are generally computed via the formula below:

| Range      | Grade |
|------------|-------|
| [100-97]   | A+    |
| [97-93]    | A     |
| [93-90]    | A-    |
| [90-87]    | B+    |
| [87-83]    | B     |
| [83-80]    | B-    |
| [80-77]    | C+    |
| [77-73]    | C     |
| [73-70]    | C-    |
| [70-67]    | D+    |
| [67-60]    | D     |
| [60-0]     | F     |

The only extra credit opportunities usually offered are for completing your end-of-term course evaluations and any course feedback surveys sent out by your instructor.

## Discord etiquette

- If you have a general question about assignment requirements or how to approach a problem, we encourage you to post in the public #questions channel so everyone can read our answers. If you have a more specific question or feel shy, you can message a TA/instructor directly. Never post solutions in a public channel.
- Be professional, respectful, and polite to your fellow students and TAs/instructors. We like to have fun, but remember that our Discord server is a classroom environment. Help us create a welcoming environment by avoiding inapproprate jokes, swearing, or rudeness. - If you violate the Student Code of Conduct, your behavior will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.
- Feel free to send messages at any time, but allow us 48 business hours to respond (though we'll usually respond sooner than that). We'll try to get to your message as soon as possible, but don't expect us to check Discord on weekends, early mornings, or late at night. If you want guaranteed immediate responses, come to class or office hours. If you wait until just before a deadline to ask for help, you probably won't get help in time. That's on you. Plan ahead.
- Your TAs are human beings and students like you. Please treat them with respect. Please also respect your professors' time. We care deeply about your education, but we have to balance your needs with our needs and the needs of all of our students.

## Academic Integrity Policies

This course follows both the [CCI Conduct Policy](https://drexel.edu/cci/current-students/policies/) and the [Drexel University Academic Integrity Policy](https://drexel.edu/studentlife/community_standards/code-of-conduct/academic-integrity-policy/).

In short, your work must be your own. Unless explicitly allowed, sharing solutions with anyone who is not an instructor or TA, borrowing significant ideas or code from any resource not given in class, or using AI tools to generate code is prohibited. See the attached PDF for more details. If you're unsure whether some behavior may violate the Academic Integrity Policy, you are always welcome to ask in advance. You will never be punished for asking.

All academic integrity violations will be reported to the university:
- The first time you violate the Academic Integrity Policy in this course this term, you will receive either a zero on the assignment or exam the violation took place on, or a deduction of one whole letter grade from your course final grade (e.g. an A- becomes a B-), depending on the severity of the violation.
  - If your first violation is unusually severe (e.g. stealing exam solutions and distributing them to the class before a test), you may receive an F after your first violation.
- If you violate the Academic Integrity Policy a subsequent time in this course this term, you will receive an F for your course final grade.

## University policies

In addition to the policies listed on this syllabus, course assignments, or the course website, the following university policies are in effect:
- [Academic Integrity Policy](https://drexel.edu/provost/policies/academic-integrity/)
- [Disability Resources](https://drexel.edu/oed/disabilityResources/students/)
- [Course Add/Drop Policy](https://drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-add-drop/)
- [Course Withdrawal Policy](https://drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-withdrawal/)
- [Exam Policy](https://drexel.edu/registrar/scheduling/exams/exam-policy/)
- Course Change Policy: The instructor may, at their discretion, change any part of the course during the term, including assignments, grade breakdowns, due dates, and the schedule. Such changes will be communicated to students via the course website Announcements page or our Discord channels. These channels should be checked regularly and frequently for changes. Other announcements, although rare, may include class cancellations and other urgent communications.
- Initial Course Participation (ICP): Class attendance is critical to your success as a student. Missing class may impact your class success and your federal financial aid.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion statement

The College of Computing & Informatics commits to creating a positive and safe learning environment for everyone – instructors, professional staff, and students – both inside and outside of the classroom. We embrace the diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences that each community member brings, and we honor everyone’s identity (including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, age, gender, socioeconomic status, sexuality, religion, veteran status, and disability). We encourage each community member to share information regarding pronouns, religious and cultural holidays, accommodations, and any other information that will assist instructors in fostering a supportive and inclusive community environment.
